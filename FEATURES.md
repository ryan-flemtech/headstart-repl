## Session Features

- Waiting room with auto-advance when teacher starts session
- Session pause/resume (`isPaused` — freezes student navigation without ending session)
- Session restart (clears all student nodes and resets to `waiting`)
- Session end → all students see end screen

---

## Teacher Features

### Session Management
- Create, start, pause/resume, end, restart session
- Share link button (copies `?live=true` URL)
- Lesson elapsed timer with planned total and per-task countdown that flashes when time expires

### Task Navigator
- Task list with group collapse
- Aggregate stats per task: run count, check passed count
- Click to advance whole class to any task
- Previous / Next navigation buttons
- Sandbox / Return to Lesson button
- Pause / Resume button

### Teacher Editor
- Starter / Complete code toggle (view reference solution)
- Python: CodeEditor + output panel + Run
- HTML: tabbed file editor + iframe preview + Run; Push to All in sandbox
- Scratch: multi-sprite workspace + stage canvas

### Student Grid
- Dynamic — no hard cap (soft max ~12)
- Per-card: name, online badge, run-status dot, check-passed badge, code/output/quiz preview
- Expand button → StudentModal

### StudentModal
- Full workspace view: code/output/iframe/quiz/Scratch stage
- Go Live / Stop Live (one-to-one keystroke streaming)
- Live code selection/cursor highlight plus copy, paste, and click activity notices
- Remote Reset to Starter (loads `starterCode`/`starterFiles`/`starterBlocks`)
- Remote Reset to Complete (loads `completeCode`/`completeFiles`/`completeBlocks`)
- Rename student
- Remove student

### Teacher Live Broadcast (teacherLive)
- Broadcasts teacher's (or a pinned student's) screen to **all** students simultaneously
- Activated via `?teacher=true&present=true` presentation window
- Broadcast code view includes live selection/cursor highlighting and activity notices
- Cleared on teacher disconnect via `onDisconnect`

### Sandbox Mode
- Freeform coding state — no task, no explainer, no checks
- Push to All (Python: pushes code string; HTML: pushes file set; Scratch: pushes block state)
- Students save current task code before entering; it is restored on exit
- Student editors accept student typing and running during sandbox

---

## Student Features

### Session Entry
- Landing page: enter lesson ID to navigate
- Choice screen: Wait for Teacher or Work Solo (when no active session)
- JoinSessionPrompt: modal to join a session that started while working solo
- Name entry with duplicate-suffix handling (`Jamie` → `Jamie-2`)
- Automatic session detection via timestamp comparison (returns to same session seamlessly)

### Lesson UI
- Top bar: lesson title, level badge, SOLO/LIVE/SANDBOX badge, student name, progress dots
- Task progress dots: clickable (past tasks), locked (future), current highlighted
- Collapsible explainer panel (Markdown with Scratch block visualization)
- Searchable topic library in explainers, with hover definitions and linked related topics
- Retro typing animation on Python output

### Task Navigation
- Live session: teacher-controlled; cannot advance past current task
- Solo mode: free navigation; one task ahead unlocked when check passes
- Previous tasks: viewable in read-only (red tint); re-runnable in solo mode

### Completion Checks
- Evaluated automatically on Run or Submit
- Pass: green banner + Firebase `checkPassed` updated
- Live session failures: hint shown after repeated identical failure; "Show complete code" unlocked after 2+

### Code Editing
- Python: CodeMirror with Pyodide status (loading → ready → error)
- HTML: tabbed editor with optional asset browser drawer (AssetBrowser)
- Scratch: multi-sprite Blockly workspace with stage canvas
- Quiz: polymorphic QuizTask component

### Sync (when watched by teacher)
- Python: code synced per keystroke, output streamed line by line during run
- HTML: active-tab files synced per keystroke
- Python/HTML: selection, cursor position, copy/paste, and click activity synced during live viewing
- Quiz: answer synced on submit
- Completely silent — no student-facing indicator

### Remote Reset
- Silently applied when teacher pushes reset; student sees code replace with no prompt

### Teacher Live Broadcast (receiving)
- `isForcedTeacherLive = true`: student's editor replaced with broadcast view
- Student cannot interact while receiving broadcast

### input() (Python)
- Execution pauses; inline input field appears in output panel
- Multiple sequential calls handled in sequence

## Lesson Builder Features

- HTML: iframe execution with check verification (element and output checks)
- Scratch: workspace execution with manual check evaluation
- After run: check result shown (✅ pass / ⚠️ fail)

### Export & Import
- Download JSON: filename `{lessonId}.json`, task IDs normalized sequentially
- Upload JSON: validates structure, populates all fields
- Auto-save to localStorage on every change
- Restore prompt on page load if in-progress lesson found
- `beforeunload` warning on unsaved changes

### Validation
- Errors (block download): missing ID/title, invalid ID format, no tasks, invalid estimated minutes, empty check value, quiz < 2 options, no correct answer, duplicate HTML filenames, invalid carry reference

### Preview
- PreviewView renders full StudentView with current lesson for teacher to test student experience

- Blob URL virtual filesystem: cross-reference rewriting, CSP injection, console interceptor
- Markdown renderer: tables, callouts (warning/error/success/info), code blocks, Scratch block display
- Shared topic-library JSON loader, type-filtered search, hover cards and library dialog
- Task group utilities: flatten, progress tracking, auto-title subtasks
- Responsive layout via `useIsMobile` hook (640px breakpoint)
